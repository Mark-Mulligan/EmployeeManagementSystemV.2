## Installation

### Run the Project Locally
** This project requires node.js so make sure that is installed on your system before doing anything else. **
** Also, this project uses a mySQL database so make sure that is installed.  I would also recommending installing mySQL Workbench so it is easier to populate create and populate the database for this project.  

* Step 1: Navigate to the directory you want to store the project. Clone this your repository to your local computer using the command below. 
```bash
https://github.com/MarkMulligan97/EmployeeManagementSystemV.2.git
```

* Step 2: Use the command line to navigate to the directory that you cloned the project.
Example:
```bash
cd directory/projectdirectory
```

* Step 3: Install the npm package dependencies from the package.json file.
```bash
npm install
```

* Step 4: Change the information in the connection.js file in the config folder so that is corresponds to the correct information to run locally on your machine.  

* Step 5: Start an instance of mySQL on your local machine.

* Step 6: Using either a the command line or GUI (such as mySQL Workbench) to interact with mySQL, create the database required for this project using the schema.sql file.

* Step 7: Populate this database with using the seed.sql file.

* Step 8: After creating the database and populating it, run the program using node with the following command.
```bash
node server.js
```

* Step 9: Once the program is started, use the commandline to respond to the prompts.
